<h1>OpenSRQPI App </h1>


<h2>What is it? </h2>
The OpenSRQPI App is an open-access, GUI-based computational platform for super-resolution reconstruction in QPI using both structured and oblique illumination. Whereas open-source tools for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), including fairSIM, SIMToolbox, and Open-3DSIM, have enabled widespread adoption of fluorescent-based SIM in life sciences by lowering computational barriers and offering robust image validation workflows, such resources are notably absent in the domain of QPI. Unlike qualitative fluorescence SIM imaging, QPI requires precise phase estimation across the entire field of view, where even small inaccuracies can distort quantitative analysis. 

<h2>What will you finde here? </h2>
This repository hosts the complete distribution of a MATLAB application developed in version R2025a, designed for advanced processing and compensation of digital holograms acquired under oblique illumination and structured illumination conditions. To ensure broad accessibility, we provide not only the open-source code but also a compiled standalone executable and a packaged installer, allowing users to run the software without requiring a full MATLAB environment. 
In addition, the repository includes a set of test datasets to facilitate immediate experimentation and validation of the appâ€™s functionality. For oblique illumination, we supply simulated holograms both in ideal, noise-free conditions and in noisy scenarios with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 40, enabling users to evaluate performance across different noise levels. For structured illumination, the test material comprises noise-free simulations alongside real experimental images, offering a comprehensive reference for both synthetic and practical cases. By combining code, executables, and curated datasets, this repository is intended to serve as a complete platform for researchers and practitioners to explore, test, and extend the capabilities of the developed application.
